# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problem
CSP, read README for description

Consider the following constraint satisfaction problem. A graph has nodes of the following types:

Triangle
Circle
Square
Hexagon
Pentagon
Each node has a domain of {1, 2, ..., 9}.

Each node type as the following constraints on its value:

Triangle - The leftmost digit of the product of all of its neightbors
Square - The rightmost digit of of the product of all its neighbors
Hexagon - The leftmost digit of the sum of all its neighbors
Pentagon - The rightmost digit of the sum of all its neighbors
Circle - No contraints
